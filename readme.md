Hi! 

I introduce you my project where I tried to have some fun with Three JS. This is the JS library that allows developers to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. Here I played with basic forms such as cube, capsule and cone. 

For this project, I used Vanilla JS, SCSS and Three JS (revision 144).

Let me know how you like this project!

Here's the link to the website: https://avlakh.github.io/r_d_blockchain/.
